# 🚀 AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System
Predict machine failures before they happen!  

This project analyzes sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure) and uses machine learning to predict machine failures **7 days in advance**. The system also provides **real-time visualizations** of sensor trends.

## 🔧 Features  
✔ **Machine Learning Model** – Uses **RandomForest** to predict failures based on past sensor trends.  
✔ **Real-Time Sensor Dashboard** – Displays live sensor readings using **Streamlit**.  
✔ **Failure Prediction Alerts** – Detects anomalies and flags machines at risk of failure.  
✔ **Data Visualization** – Interactive charts showing **temperature, vibration, and pressure** over time.
